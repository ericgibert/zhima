2. Member JSON Structure
------------------------

Member is defined as:

    {
        openid: "ozckH0TkSadGgyeAb5Bn390qQMa8",   // the only and unique ID of a member.
        avatarUrl: "https://wx.qlogo.cn/mmopen/vi_32/GPm0HkJtcIsWkZmVNaxJP19ibl1g2YJTEibglP0UibOZstaRN1lbuMavu1a1Y795p6J1vHz0bM27icibCiat9ERricyng/0",    // member`s PICTURE
        basicInfo:
          {
            city: "",
            country: "South Korea",
            gender: 1,
            language: "zh_CN",
            nickName: "JOHN:",
            province: ""
          },
        memberInfo:
        {
            createTime: '201505011522'        // first time of member`s info creation in this system
            lastUpdate: '201801011420',       // last member information modification time
            lastActiveTime: '201803021530',   // last member active time (e.g: came to xinchejian and operate something)
            lastActiveType: 'Open the door/ paid for membership',    // lastest action type: opened the door or paid the membership or bought a drink from xcj
            expireTime: '201903111928',       // membership expire date and time
            tags: ['member', 'staff', 'manager', 'teacher', 'admin', 'cooperater', 'visiter'],       // member`s tag, to decide the priviledge of a member
            memo: ''            // for admin use: take extra notes, e.g:this member asked for refund.
        },
        paymentInfo:
        {
            paidTime: '201803121929',     // last payment date and time
            payIndex: '9cu293820xxjfiuewfdsfdse32',   // the lastest payment index number, this is a unique random codes generated by wechat pay and alipay system and our system.
            CNYAmount: '3200',            // how much is the last payment.
        }
    }



3. Response JSON Structure
--------------------------

Classic Response for a successful operation:

    {
        'errno': '1000',  #// no error with 1000, error numbers for others
        'errmsg': "Success",
        'data': {'new_id': new_id}   # // you may put data at here,in json format.
    }

Any error number _errno_ > 1000 indicates an error. Refer to the _errmsg_ for more information.

- 1001: Member information is missing and prevents the Member JSO structure generation
- 1002: Member JSON object received in the API body is NOT correct
- 1003: Member cannot be instered in database: database integrity/duplicate key on insert (like nickname duplicate)
- 1999: Member not found (_GET_ or _PATCH_)
